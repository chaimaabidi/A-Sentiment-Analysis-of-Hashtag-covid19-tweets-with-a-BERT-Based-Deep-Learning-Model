# A-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Hashtag-covid19-tweets-with-a-BERT-Based-Deep-Learning-Model
Research Master's degree project:
We examined a dataset of tweets based on hashtag phrases, and COVID-19 was among them.  Sentiment analysis was used to determine the influence of the pandemic on people's mental health by analyzing Twitter data and, in particular, sentiment analysis. 
We used BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers to classify sentiment ratings as positive, negative, or neutral. 
The Python programming language was used to implement all the models used in this study. 
Compared to other classifiers, our BERT-based deep learning model outperforms machine learning models (Naive bayse/Random forest/Xgboost SVM) in terms of precision and accuracy.
